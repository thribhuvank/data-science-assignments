    "Q1. Which two operator overloading methods can you use in your classes to support iteration?\n",
    "Ans: The __iter__ returns the iterator object and is implicitly called at the start of loops. The __next__ method returns the next value and is implicitly called at each loop increment. __next__ raises a StopIteration exception when there are no more value to return, which is implicitly captured by looping constructs to stop iterating.\n",

    "Q2. In what contexts do the two operator overloading methods manage printing?\n",
    "Ans: Overloading, in the context of programming, refers to the ability of a function or an operator to behave in different ways depending on the parameters that are passed to the function, or the operands that the operator acts on. In Python, operator overloading (also known as “operator ad-hoc polymorphism”) in particular is a form of ‘syntactic sugar’ that enables powerful and convenient ways to prescribe an operator’s, er, operations, as an infix expression of specified types. Said another way, operator overloading gives extended meaning to operators beyond their pre-defined operational meaning.\n",

    "Q3. In a class, how do you intercept slice operations?\n",
    "Ans: \"setslice\" and \"delslice\" are deprecated, if you want to do the interception you need to work with python slice objects passed to \"setitem\" and \"delitem\". If you want to intecept both slices and ordinary accesses this code works perfectly in python 2.6.2.\n",

    "Q4. In a class, how do you capture in-place addition?\n",
    "Ans: Python provides the operator x += y to add two objects in-place by calculating the sum x + y and assigning the result to the first operands variable name x. You can set up the in-place addition behavior for your own class by overriding the magic “dunder” method __iadd__(self, other) in your class definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression x += y is syntactical sugar for the longer-form x = x + y:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. When is it appropriate to use operator overloading?\n",
    "Ans: Operator overloading is mostly useful when you're making a new class that falls into an existing \"Abstract Base Class\" (ABC) -- indeed, many of the ABCs in standard library module collections rely on the presence of certain special methods (and special methods, one with names starting and ending with double underscores "
