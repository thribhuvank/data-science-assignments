    "Q1. In Python 3.X, what are the names and functions of string object types?\n",
    "Ans: Python String is immutable, so all these functions return a new string and the original string remains unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "String Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "format(): Itâ€™s used to create a formatted string from the template string and the supplied values.\n",
    "\n",
    "split(): Python string split() function is used to split a string into the list of strings based on a delimiter.\n",
    "\n",
    "join(): This function returns a new string that is the concatenation of the strings in iterable with string object as a delimiter.\n",
    "\n",
    "strip(): Used to trim whitespaces from the string object.\n",
    "\n",
    "format_map(): Python string format_map() function returns a formatted version of the string using substitutions from the mapping provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "upper(): We can convert a string to uppercase in Python using str.upper() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "lower(): This function creates a new string in lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "replace(): Python string replace() function is used to create a new string by replacing some parts of another string.\n",
    "\n",
    "find(): Python String find() method is used to find the index of a substring in a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "translate(): Python String translate() function returns a new string with each character in the string replaced using the given translation table. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. How do the string forms in Python 3.X vary in terms of operations?\n",
    "Ans : The built-in string class provides the ability to do complex variable substitutions and value formatting via the format() method. The Formatter class in the string module allows you to create and customize your own string formatting behaviors using the same implementation as the built-in format() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. In Python 3.X, how do you put non-ASCII Unicode characters in a string?\n",
    "Ans: Python allows Unicode string literals to be specified by adding a u character prefix before the string literal: This will create a Unicode string and the label will be appear correctly. Using Python and Unicode is a large topic which is beyond the scope of this document.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. In Python 3.X, what are the key differences between text-mode and binary-mode files?\n",
    "Ans : Binary file contains the data in the form of 0 and 1(series of binary values) and text files contains the data in the form of stream of characters.In general binary files are identified as executable files. But binary files are not in readable form as like text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. How can you interpret a Unicode text file containing text encoded in a different encoding than your platform's default?\n",
    "Ans: The Unicode Transformation Format (UTF) is a character encoding format which is able to encode all of the possible character code points in Unicode. The most prolific is UTF-8, which is a variable-length encoding and uses 8-bit code units, designed for backwards compatibility with ASCII encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What is the best way to make a Unicode text file in a particular encoding format?\n",
    "Ans: Encode method does, and the result of encoding a unicode string is a bytestring (a str type.) You should either use normal open() and encode the unicode yourself, or (usually a better idea) use codecs. open() and not encode the data yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. What qualifies ASCII text as a form of Unicode text?\n",
    "Ans: ASCII == UNICODE? For backward compatibility, the first 128 Unicode characters point to ASCII characters. And since UTF-8 encodes each of those characters using 1-byte. ASCII is essentially just UTF-8, or we can say that ASCII is a subset of Unicode.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. How much of an effect does the change in string types in Python 3.X have on your code?\n",
    "Ans: Python 3.0 uses the concepts of text and (binary) data instead of Unicode strings and 8-bit strings. All text is Unicode; however encoded Unicode is represented"
